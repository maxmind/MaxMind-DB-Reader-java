CHANGELOG
=========

4.0.0
------------------

* Java 17 or greater is now required.
* Added support for MaxMind DB files larger than 2GB. The library now uses
  an internal Buffer abstraction that can handle databases exceeding the
  2GB ByteBuffer limit. Files under 2GB continue to use a single ByteBuffer
  for optimal performance. Requested by nonetallt. GitHub #154. Fixed by
  Silvano Cerza. GitHub #289.
* `DatabaseRecord`, `Metadata`, `Network`, and internal `DecodedValue` classes
  have been converted to records. The following API changes were made:
  * `DatabaseRecord.getData()` and `DatabaseRecord.getNetwork()` have been
    replaced with record accessor methods `data()` and `network()`.
  * `Metadata.getBuildDate()` has been renamed to `buildDate()` to follow record
    naming conventions. All other simple getter methods on `Metadata` (e.g.,
    `getBinaryFormatMajorVersion()`, `getDatabaseType()`, etc.) have been
    replaced with their corresponding record accessor methods (e.g.,
    `binaryFormatMajorVersion()`, `databaseType()`, etc.).
  * `Network.getNetworkAddress()` and `Network.getPrefixLength()` have been
    replaced with record accessor methods `networkAddress()` and `prefixLength()`.

3.2.0 (2025-05-28)
------------------

* First release using Central Portal instead of Legacy OSSRH.
* Improve internal uses of types and other code cleanups. Pull requests
  by Philippe Marschall. GitHub #246, #247, #248, and #249.

3.1.1 (2024-09-19)
------------------

* When handling a deserialization exception, the decoder now avoids
  throwing a `NullPointerException` when one of the constructor arguments
  is `null`. Reported by Keith Massey. GitHub #164.

3.1.0 (2023-12-05)
------------------

* Reader supports iterating over the whole database or within a network.

3.0.0 (2022-12-12)
------------------

* Java 11 or greater is now required.
* This library is now a Java module.

2.1.0 (2022-10-31)
------------------

* Messages for `DeserializationException` have been improved, and the cause
  is included, if any. Moreover, the message provides detail about the involved
  types, if the exception is caused by an `IllegalArgumentException`.

2.0.0 (2020-10-13)
------------------

* No changes since 2.0.0-rc2.

2.0.0-rc2 (2020-09-29)
----------------------

* Build using the `--release` command-line option so linking when using
  Java 8 works.

2.0.0-rc1 (2020-09-24)
----------------------

* Significant API changes. The `get()` and `getRecord()` methods now take a
  class parameter specifying the type of object to deserialize into. You
  can either deserialize into a `Map` or to model classes that use the
  `MaxMindDbConstructor` and `MaxMindDbParameter` annotations to identify
  the constructors and parameters to deserialize into.
* `jackson-databind` is no longer a dependency.
* The `Record` class is now named `DatabaseRecord`. This is to avoid a
  conflict with `java.lang.Record` in Java 14.

1.4.0 (2020-06-12)
------------------

* IMPORTANT: Java 8 is now required. If you need Java 7 support, please
  continue using 1.3.1 or earlier.
* The decoder will now throw an `InvalidDatabaseException` on an invalid
  control byte in the data section rather than an
  `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Reported by Edwin Delgado H. GitHub
  #68.
* In order to improve performance when lookups are done from multiple
  threads, a use of `synchronized` has been removed. GitHub #65 & #69.
* `jackson-databind` has been upgraded to 2.11.0.

1.3.1 (2020-03-03)
------------------

* Correctly decode strings that are between 157 and 288 bytes long. 1.3.0
  introduced a regression when decoding these due to using a signed `byte`
  as an unsigned value. Reported by Dongmin Yu. GitHub #181 in
  maxmind/GeoIP2-java.
* Update `jackson-databind` dependency.

1.3.0 (2019-12-13)
------------------

* IMPORTANT: Java 7 is now required. If you need Java 6 support, please
  continue using 1.2.2 or earlier.
* The method `getRecord` was added to `com.maxmind.db.Reader`. This method
  returns a `com.maxmind.db.Record` object that includes the data for the
  record as well as the network associated with the record.

1.2.2 (2017-02-22)
------------------

* Remove the version range. As of today, `jackson-databind` is no longer
  resolved correctly when a range is used. GitHub #28.

1.2.1 (2016-04-15)
------------------

* Specify a hard minimum dependency for `jackson-databind`. This API will not
  work with versions earlier than 2.7.0, and Maven's nearest-first resolution
  rule often pulled in older versions.

1.2.0 (2016-01-13)
------------------

* `JsonNode` containers returned by the `get(ip)` are now backed by
  unmodifiable collections. Any mutation done to them will fail with an
  `UnsupportedOperationException` exception. This allows safe caching of the
  nodes to be done without doing a deep copy of the cached data. Pull request
  by Viktor Szathm치ry. GitHub #24.

1.1.0 (2016-01-04)
------------------

* The reader now supports pluggable caching of the decoded data. By default,
  no caching is performed. Please see the `README.md` file or the API docs
  for information on how to enable caching. Pull requests by Viktor Szathm치ry.
  GitHub #21.
* This release also includes several additional performance enhancements as
  well as code cleanup from Viktor Szathm치ry. GitHub #18, #19, #20, #22,and
  #23.

1.0.1 (2015-12-17)
------------------

* Several optimizations have been made to reduce allocations when decoding a
  record. Pull requests by Viktor Szathm치ry. GitHub #16 & #17.

1.0.0 (2014-09-29)
------------------

* First production release.

0.4.0 (2014-09-23)
------------------

* Made `com.maxmind.db.Metadata` public and added public getters for most
  of the interesting metadata. This is accessible through the `getMetadata()`
  method on a `Reader` object.

0.3.4 (2014-08-27)
------------------

* Previously the Reader would hold onto the underlying file and FileChannel,
  not closing them until the Reader was closed. This was unnecessary; they
  are now closed immediately after they are used. Fix by Andrew Snare; GitHub
  issue #7.
* The Reader now discards the reference to the underlying buffer when
  `close()` is called. This is done to help ensure that the buffer is garbage
  collected sooner, which may mitigate file locking issues that some users
  have experienced on Windows when updating the database. Patch by Andrew
  Snare; GitHub issue #8.

0.3.3 (2014-06-02)
------------------

* A potential (small) resource leak when using this library with a thread
  pool was fixed.

0.3.2 (2014-04-02)
------------------

* Added tests and documentation for multi-threaded use.

0.3.1 (2013-11-05)
------------------

* An `InputStream` constructor was added to the `Reader` class. This reads the
  stream into memory as if it was using `FileMode.MEMORY`. Patch by Matthew
  Daniel.
* The source code is now attached during packaging. Patch by Matthew Daniel.
* The artifact ID was changed to `maxmind-db` in order to increase naming
  consistency.

0.3.0 (2013-10-17)
------------------

* IMPORTANT: The package name was changed to `com.maxmind.db`. The
  `MaxMindDbReader` class was renamed to `Reader`.
* Improved error handling and test coverage.
* Performance improvements.

0.2.0 (2013-07-08)
------------------

* The reader and database format now uses IEEE 754 doubles and floats.
* FileMode.IN_MEMORY was renamed to FileMode.MEMORY.
* Cache Type enum values array.

0.1.0 (2013-06-14)
------------------

* Initial release
